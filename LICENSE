If you start making a ton of money/social capital off my code and don't attribute me, you are a dick. Aside from that caveat, this code is available for modification/re-use/parody/circus performances/etc, commercial or otherwise. I reserve the right to change this license at any point, but any such change will be active for revisions posted from that date forward only, and will not apply backwards to revisions posted previous to that date (as determined by the timestamp on whatever machine I am doing development on at the time).
