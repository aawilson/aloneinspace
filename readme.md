Alone in Space
==============

This is me farting around in a Roguelike. The conceit is that you are on a ship in space.

Right now you can move around and bump into walls. It's not visible, but there are airless squares beyond the walls (windows allowing you to see them coming soon!).

There is also a "camera" you can switch to using "tab" and "shift+tab". It points in a random direction and has a 90 degree arc. If you're not in the arc, you can't see yourself when switched to the camera.
